Total execution time: 9

INFO:
at time t=0, load operations involving input operands for the algorithm are carried out.
Hence, the amount of memory rows that are active at t=0 refer to all those rows containing input operands for the algorithm, which are loaded at the beginning of the same algorithm execution.
All time instants after t=0 are needed for the execution of the algorithm, hence the total execution time is equal to the last time instant provided in this file.
